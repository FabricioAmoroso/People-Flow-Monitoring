## Project operation

### Description

The following project has the purpose to monitor indoor environments in order to detect people flow.
There are three main features: Area of Interest detection, Social Distancing monitorng and Real Time People Counting.

- Area of Interest: Obtains information of the busiest areas(i.e. areas of most interest by people) by updating a HeatMap fed by peoples positions.
- Social Distancing: Continuously detect and show possible people at risk for being too close to others by estimating the distance between both.
- Real Time People Counting: Keeps a real time detection of how many people are in the monitored environment(inside camera view).
