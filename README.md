## Project operation

### Description

![](People-Monitoring.gif)

The following project has the purpose to monitor indoor environments in order to detect people flow.
There are three main features: Area of Interest detection, Social Distancing monitorng and Real Time People Counting.

- Area of Interest: Obtains information of the busiest areas(i.e. areas of most interest by people) by updating a HeatMap fed by peoples positions.
- Social Distancing: Continuously detect and show possible people at risk for being too close to others by estimating the distance between both.
- Real Time People Counting: Keeps a real time detection of how many people are in the monitored environment(inside camera view).

## Recommendations for using the repository
- Use conda to create virtual environments.
- Use cuda and cudnn for better performance (verify if GPU is compatible).
- Linux is recommended for all procedures.

## Installation

### Python 

Recommended version 3.7.

### Create a conda virtual environment

`conda create -n <environment-name> python=3.7`<br/>
`conda activate <environment-name>`<br/>
`conda install cudatoolkit=10.2 cudnn=7.6.5`

### Download the repository
Download the repository or clone by executing in the shell `git clone https://github.com/FabricioAmoroso/People-Flow-Monitoring.git`.

### Necessary dependencies
In order to properly install all the requirements <br/>
`cd People-Flow-Monitoring`<br/>
`pip install -r requirements.txt`<br/>

### Run code

`python distanciamento.py --source 0 --weights yolov5s.pt --conf 0.25 --classes 0`

### Files guide

[**distanciamento.py**](https://github.com/FabricioAmoroso/People-Flow-Monitoring/blob/master/distanciamento.py) main code that calls the Heatmap class and implements people distancing and counting. 

[**heatmap.py**](https://github.com/FabricioAmoroso/People-Flow-Monitoring/blob/master/heatmap.py) is the HeatMap class.
